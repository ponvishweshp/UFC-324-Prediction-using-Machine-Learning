🥊 UFC Fight Outcome Prediction using Machine Learning & Monte Carlo Simulation
📌 Project Overview


Predicting MMA fight outcomes is uniquely challenging due to small sample sizes, rapidly evolving fighter styles, aging effects, and high randomness.
This project attempts to address these challenges by combining domain-driven feature engineering, ensemble machine learning models, and Monte Carlo simulations to generate probabilistic fight narratives — not just a single winner.

The case study focuses on the matchup between Justin Gaethje and Paddy Pimblett.

⚠️ This project is for educational and analytical purposes only.
It is not a betting model.

🎯 Objectives

Predict the likely winner of a UFC fight

Estimate method of victory (KO/TKO, Submission, Decision)

Estimate round of finish

Quantify uncertainty using probabilistic simulations

Demonstrate how domain knowledge + ML improves predictions in sparse datasets

🧠 Modeling Approach
1️⃣ Feature Engineering

Raw fight statistics were transformed into composite features inspired by MMA analysis:

Experience Index

Finishing Ability Score

Durability / Damage Absorption

Striking vs Grappling Bias

Age & Career Stage Adjustment

Style Matchup Heuristics

These features aim to capture fight dynamics rather than just historical averages.

2️⃣ Machine Learning Models

Multiple models were trained to capture different perspectives of fight outcomes:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest


Model outputs were ensembled to reduce bias and variance.

3️⃣ Monte Carlo Simulation

To move beyond a single deterministic prediction, a 1,000-run Monte Carlo simulation was performed using model-derived probabilities.

Each simulation sampled:

Fight winner

Method of victory

Round of finish

This produced distribution-based insights, such as:

Most frequent winners

Common finish methods

Likely round ranges

High-probability outcome narratives

📊 Key Results
Monte Carlo Summary

Most frequent simulated winner: Paddy Pimblett

Most common finish method: Submission

Most common finish rounds: Rounds 1–2

Top simulated outcomes:

Paddy Pimblett wins by Submission in Round 1

Justin Gaethje wins by KO/TKO in Round 1

Final Combined Narrative
Component	Prediction
Favored Fighter	Justin Gaethje
Advantage Level	Slight
Likely Win Method	KO/TKO
Likely Round Range	Rounds 1–2
Uncertainty Level	High (limited historical data)
⚠️ Uncertainty & Limitations

MMA fights have low data availability

Subjective factors (fight IQ, camp quality, mindset) are difficult to quantify

Injuries and weight cuts are not fully observable

Predictions are probabilistic, not deterministic

This uncertainty is explicitly modeled using simulations rather than ignored.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

NumPy, Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Jupyter / Google Colab

  Update: The model successfully predicted the winner of the match, prior to the event.
  

🚀 Future Improvements

Incorporate subjective analyst ratings (stamina, fight IQ, chin)

Add time-decay weighting for older fights

Expand dataset to multi-division modeling

Bayesian updating after weigh-ins and face-offs

Add explainability (SHAP) for feature impact
